* write unit tests
* Good files handling on updates and deletes
* A task to generate all thumbnails at once (options = model, fields, formats)
* A ``keep_original`` settings, if you ever want to delete the original picture
* An ``allow_empty`` parameter
  after thumbnail creations (in case it's huge)
* Allow a different thumbnail object injection
* A settings compatibility chart (I guess that's something that points an
  overconfigurable plugin :s)
* Remove dependency to sfConfig for sf_upload_dir
